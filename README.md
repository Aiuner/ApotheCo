## Overview

_**ApotheCo** is an informational wiki containing a growing collection of articles on various plants, fungi, animal byproducts, etc. with information on their identification, properties, and uses in several contexts. Users of the wiki are able to make accounts and create their own articles, and suggest edits/comment on articles written by others._

<br>

## MVP

_The **ApotheCo** MVP is to have a functional full-stack web application with a Postgres database serving data to the client-side via axios calls, and a simple and attractive user interface. The application will also feature user authentication, allowing individuals to have accounts with which to create and edit new articles and post comments on other articles._

<br>

### Goals

- _Ruby on Rails back-end. RESTful JSON API with a Postgres database that has tables for users, articles, and suggested edits/comments._
- _Full CRUD for articles and suggested edits/comments._
- _React.js front-end with full CRUD for articles and suggested edits/comments._
- _Make API calls from my front-end to my back-end to populate app with data from my database._
- _Have a simple, clean, and stylish interface for users to explore the wiki and add new content._
